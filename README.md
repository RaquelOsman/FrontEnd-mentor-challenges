## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - For styles

### What I learned

I am comfortable with the overall layout in HTML but I admit to facing some challenges when it came to grid work in CSS. It took me a while but as evident by my solution I got through it. I still have more work to do but I am looking forward to more challenges.  
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  margin: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

```

### Continued development

I experienced challenges when it came to committing and publishing my work onto GitHub, but i have worked on it now. I hope to get more comfortable with it as I do more projects.
Grid work is a point of interest to me and i will be working on it thanks to various app and games that I have been introduced to.
